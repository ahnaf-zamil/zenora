# Zenora

A simple to use API wrapper for the Discord REST API in Python

## ATTENTION

The development of this project has been moved to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ahnaf-zamil/zenora). The README *here* is incomplete, and the full README is available on the GitLab repository along with examples, installation guides, etc. No PR or issues on this repo will be responded to, please make them on the GitLab repo. Thank you :) 

## What is Zenora

Zenora is a synchronous library for accessing the Discord REST API. It allows you to access the API without async/await. And also gives you REST-only API access, not the gateway. Pretty useful for making bot web dashboards, or desktop applications, etc. There's some Oauth features as well
